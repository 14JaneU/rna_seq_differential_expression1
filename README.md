## RNA-Seq Differential Expression Project 

## Project Outline
This project implements a modular RNA-Seq differential expression pipeline in Python, designed to simulate real-world transcriptomic analysis workflows including quality control, normalisation, statistical testing, and data visualisation.

## Research Question
Which genes are significantly differentially expressed between colorectal tumour tissue and matched normal tissue?

## Current Features

- RNA-Seq count data loading pipeline
- Quality control metrics (library size & gene detection)
- CPM normalisation implementation
- Modular Python bioinformatics workflow

## In Development

- Differential expression statistical testing
- Visualisation tools
- Result export functionality

## Skills Demonstrated

- Transcriptomic data processing
- Statistical bioinformatics
- Python scientific computing
- Modular software development
- Reproducible research workflows
